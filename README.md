3. manager. Cabinet Sections: 
A.	Internal warehouse(has the right to form kits for the sales warehouse. Can both send to the sales warehouse one block/bulk and form a set (machine).
B.	Claims Request. If after buying a stone the client sees that the volume of stone after primary processing does not correspond to the purchased one - he has the right to request a complaint in his personal cabinet. The manager sees it and comes for inspection. If the stone really does not correspond to the parameters, the manager sets new parameters for a particular position and the cost of the stone is automatically recalculated. There should be a beacon that the stone has a different value and we have to pay the customer the difference.
C.	He can request a price change but he cannot change it himself without the director and cerberus.
